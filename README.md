[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/pascua.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/pascua)

Get Easter date for any given year using the ["Meeus/Jones/butcher" algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus).

Easter is traditionally celebrated on the first Sunday after the [Paschal full moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_full_moon).

## Installation

To install as a dependency:

```
npm install pascua
```

## Usage

`pascua` exports a single function that takes an optional `integer` between 1583 and 4099 for the year.

```js
import pascua from "pascua";

// Easter date for the current year
const easter = pascua();

// Easter date for 1984
const easter1984 = pascua(1984);
```

The function will return an object with the following properties:

| Property     | Description                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `year`       | Year                                    |
